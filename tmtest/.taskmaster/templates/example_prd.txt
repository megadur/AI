# Overview
This application is a web-based platform that enables users to browse, view, and interact with a list of PDF documents, as well as send and read messages related to those documents. It is designed for teams, organizations, or individuals who need to manage and discuss documents in a collaborative environment. The solution streamlines document access and communication, improving productivity and knowledge sharing.

# Core Features
1. **User Authentication**
   - Secure login and registration for users.
   - Ensures only authorized access to documents and messages.
2. **PDF Document Management**
   - List available PDF documents.
   - Preview and download PDFs in-browser.
   - (Future) Upload new PDF documents.
3. **Messaging System**
   - Users can write and read messages related to documents.
   - (Future) Real-time chat and notifications.
4. **Responsive UI**
   - Intuitive navigation for desktop and mobile users.

# User Experience
**User Personas:**
- Team members collaborating on shared documents.
- Managers reviewing and discussing reports.
- Individual users organizing personal or project files.

**Key User Flows:**
1. User logs in and sees a list of available PDF documents.
2. User selects a document to preview it in-browser.
3. User reads and writes messages related to the document.
4. (Optional) User uploads a new PDF (future enhancement).

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Clean, modern interface with clear document previews.
- Easy access to messaging alongside document view.
- Mobile-friendly design.

# Technical Architecture
**System Components:**
- .NET Core Web API (backend)
- Angular SPA (frontend)
- Database (SQL Server or PostgreSQL)
- File storage (local or cloud, e.g., Azure Blob Storage)

**Data Models:**
- User: Id, Username, Email, PasswordHash, etc.
- Document: Id, Title, FilePath, UploadedBy, UploadDate
- Message: Id, DocumentId, UserId, Content, Timestamp

**APIs and Integrations:**
- RESTful endpoints for authentication, document management, and messaging
- PDF rendering in Angular (PDF.js)
- (Future) SignalR for real-time messaging

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- Hosting for backend and frontend (e.g., Azure App Service)
- Secure file storage for PDFs
- Database server

# Development Roadmap
**MVP Requirements:**
- User authentication (register, login, JWT-based auth)
- List and preview PDF documents
- Basic messaging (send/read messages per document)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Document upload and management
- Real-time chat/notifications (SignalR)
- User roles and permissions
- Search and filter for documents
- Audit logs and activity tracking

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Set up backend API and database schema
2. Implement authentication and user management
3. Develop document listing and preview (PDF rendering)
4. Add messaging functionality (per document)
5. Integrate frontend with backend APIs
6. (Future) Add document upload and real-time features

# Risks and Mitigations
- **PDF Rendering Issues:** Use established libraries (PDF.js) and test with various PDF files.
- **Real-time Messaging Complexity:** Start with simple polling, upgrade to SignalR as needed.
- **File Storage Scalability:** Design for local storage first, plan for cloud migration if usage grows.
- **Security:** Use secure authentication, validate file uploads, and sanitize user input.
- **Resource Constraints:** Prioritize MVP features, use modular architecture for easy scaling.

# Appendix
- Research: PDF.js for Angular, SignalR integration with .NET Core and Angular
- Technical specs: .NET 8+, Angular 17+, SQL Server/PostgreSQL, Azure Blob Storage (optional)
