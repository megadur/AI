			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Infrastructure and Repository",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The task is already well-expanded with 5 subtasks covering multi-module setup, database configuration, Docker environment, CORS setup, and basic project structure. The current subtask breakdown is appropriate for the complexity level.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multi-technology stack setup (Spring Boot, Angular, PostgreSQL, Docker) and multiple integration points. Already has optimal subtask breakdown covering all major components."
