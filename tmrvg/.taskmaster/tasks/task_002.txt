# Title: Implement User Authentication and Authorization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control for assessors, managers, and admins
# Details:
1) Create User entity with JPA annotations (id, name, email, password, role enum), 
2) Implement UserRepository extending JpaRepository, 
3) Create JWT utility class for token generation/validation, 
4) Implement AuthController with login/logout endpoints, 
5) Create JwtAuthenticationFilter for request interception, 
6) Configure Spring Security with JWT authentication, 
7) Implement role-based authorization (@PreAuthorize annotations), 
8) Create Angular authentication service with HTTP interceptors,

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for JWT utilities, integration tests for login endpoints, E2E tests for authentication flow, verify role-based access restrictions work correctly
